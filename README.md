## UAE E-Invoicing Integration for ERPNext

A Frappe / ERPNext application for generating UAE E-Invoicing-ready invoice data, aligned with the upcoming UAE Federal Tax Authority (FTA) e-invoicing framework and UBL 2.1 standards.

This app is designed to help ERPNext users prepare structured invoice payloads, validate UAE VAT-related requirements, and support future API-based invoice clearance and reporting workflows.

#### Overview

The UAE E-Invoicing Integration app provides a configurable foundation for UAE-compliant e-invoicing inside ERPNext.

### It focuses on:

• Generating UAE-compliant invoice data
• Preparing structured JSON payloads for future XML / UBL 2.1 mapping
• Validating VAT, TRN, HS Code, SAC Code, and invoice rules
• Supporting Sales Invoices, Credit Notes, and self-billed documents
• Preparing ERPNext invoices for future FTA clearance and reporting workflows

> Note
>
>The integration is designed with a flexible ASP (Accredited Service Provider) architecture. Any UAE-approved ASP provider can be configured and integrated with this app based on customer requirements and future UAE FTA compliance specifications.
>
>Currently, Flick is available as the initial test and reference implementation for API connectivity and workflow validation.
>
> UAE e-invoicing is currently being rolled out in phases. This implementation is designed to be future-ready, configurable, and aligned with published UAE FTA and PEPPOL-style standards.
>
> At the current stage, the structured invoice JSON generation layer is implemented. FTA submission and full clearance workflow will be added in future phases.

### Supported Document Types
# Sales / Accounts Receivable

| Code | Document Type |

### Validation Highlights

The app includes validation rules to ensure invoice data is structured correctly before generation.

## Key validations include:

• Quantity must be greater than zero
• Mandatory tax category must be present
• Credit Notes must have a valid reference invoice
• Legal identifiers must be configured before submission
• VAT / TRN details must be available where required
• HS Code is required for goods
• SAC Code is required for services
• Decimal precision is handled using ROUNDHALFUP
• Invoice transaction type must be valid
• Payment means code must be valid

## Installation

Get the app from your repository:
bench get-app uaeerpgulf https://github.com/your-org/uaeerpgulf.git


Install the app on your site:
bench --site yoursite.local install-app uaeerpgulf


Run migrations:
bench --site yoursite.local migrate


Restart bench:
bench restart


## Configuration
Enable UAE E-Invoicing

Go to:

Company → UAE E-Invoicing


Enable:

UAE E-Invoice Enabled


Make sure the company has the correct legal and tax details configured.

## API Setup

Configure the API connection details.

Required fields:

• Base URL
• Participant ID
• X-Flick-Auth-Key

These details are used for connecting with the external e-invoicing API service.

## Authentication

The app is designed to support OAuth2-based authentication.

### Authentication flow:

Verify token
Generate OAuth2 access token
Store token securely
Reuse token until expiry
Regenerate token when expired

### Fetch Participant Details

The participant details flow retrieves business registration information such as:

• VAT / TRN
• Business legal name
• Registration details
• Participant information
• Address and identification details

This helps ensure the company is properly registered and ready for invoice submission workflows.

## Invoice Flow

The expected UAE e-invoicing flow is:

User creates a Sales Invoice in ERPNext
System validates UAE E-Invoicing configuration
System validates invoice data
Invoice payload is generated
Authentication is performed using OAuth2
Invoice is sent to the configured API provider
API provider forwards invoice data to the FTA
Response is received and stored in ERPNext

## Webhooks

The app is designed to listen for real-time invoice status updates using webhooks.

Supported webhook events include:

• Invoice Submitted
• Invoice Validated
• Invoice Accepted
• Invoice Rejected
• Invoice Delivered

Webhook responses can be used to update invoice status inside ERPNext.

## Output Formats

Currently supported output:

• Structured Invoice JSON

Planned output:

• UBL 2.1-compatible XML
• FTA-ready invoice submission payload
• API clearance response mapping

> Current Status
>
> Only the structured JSON generation layer is currently implemented. FTA submission and full clearance workflows are not yet completed and will be added in future phases.
